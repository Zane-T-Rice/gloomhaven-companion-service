# Backend For Gloomhaven Companion App

Currently very much a work in progress and documentation is lacking as a result.
This backend service is one of many used by my [React app FE](https://github.com/Zane-T-Rice/apps).

Hopefully I can make something to clear up some table space while playing Gloomhaven 2E.

# Local Development

Use the scripts in the `scripts` directory. They are pretty self explanatory.
